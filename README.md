# hospital_monitoring_group29
This is the summative task for group-29

This directory contains 3 main scripts: the heart_rate_monitor.sh file, which records heart rate data every second and logs heart rate data into "heart_rate_log.txt" file. The heart_rate_monotor.sh file also runs in the background.

The second script is the "archive_log.sh" whose work is to archive the log file "heart_rate_log.txt"

The third script is the "backup_archives.sh" script that moves the archived log files into a designated directory called "archived_logs_group29"

The group consists of 6 members. We did two sessions in order to finish this project. However, one of the members could not make it due to health issues.
